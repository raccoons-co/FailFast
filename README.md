>*A clean way to well-written TypeScript prose in the Node.js galaxy.*
```
TypeScript 5.0 have implemented the new decorators standard! 
It's not required to enable experimental support for decorators any more.
```
#### Clean Way 
The library provides an `EntryPoint` to `@Test`-driven development discipline practice 
with Typescript.

- `@TestClass` is used to annotate a class that contains test methods.

- `@Test` is used to annotate a method as test method to check the correct behaviour/functionality, 
features of an application.

- `@ParametrizedTest` is used to annotate a method as parameterized test method. 
`@ParameterizedTest` methods must specify at least one `@ArgumentsSource`.

- `@ArgumentsSource` is a repeatable annotation that is used to provide an *Array* of *Arguments* 
that will be used to invoke the parameterized test method.

-  `@RepeatedTest` is used to annotate a method as test *template* method that should be repeated 
a specified number of times. Repeated test behaves like a regular `@Test` method.


- `@AfterEach` is used to annotate a method that will be executed after each test method 
in the current test class.

*@Test*, *@ParametrizedTest*, *@RepeatedTest* and *@AfterEach* methods must not be private 
or static and must not return a value.

Each test is executed separately with own object of a test class.
  
#### Simple auto-start

Create a new repository from [cleanway-skeleton](https://github.com/raccoons-co/cleanway-skeleton)
template.

#### Manual start

Install package as development dependency.

```shell script
% npm i -D @raccoons-co/cleanway
```

Implement `src/test/EntryPoint.ts`:
~~~~
import {CleanWayBuilder} from "@raccoons-co/cleanway";
import YourTest from "./YourTest";

CleanWayBuilder.instance()
    .use(YourTest)
    .build();
~~~~
Implement `src/test/YourTest.ts` in accordance to this
[example](https://github.com/raccoons-co/cleanway/blob/master/src/test/YourTest.ts).

Create `src/main/YourProgram.ts`.

Finally paste scripts section to `package.json`:
~~~~
"scripts": {
  "test": "nyc ts-node src/test/EntryPoint"
}
~~~~
Do not forget to install *istanbul, ts-node* as development dependencies and review 
[.nycrc.json](https://github.com/raccoons-co/cleanway/blob/master/.nycrc.json) as well.


#### Run

Now you are ready to follow clean way.
Run test locally and with continuous integration platform. 

~~~~shell script
% npm test
~~~~

Write `YourTest` cases, fail fast 
and have a nice journey in the Node.js galaxy.
