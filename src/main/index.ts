 * The library provides an `EntryPoint` to `@Test`-driven development discipline practice.
 * You can run `@Test`-methods and `@Log` it with annotations for your TypeScrip prose.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * @Immutable
 * export default class YourTest {
 *
 *     @Log
 *     @Test
 *     public nothing() {
 *         // But your assertions here.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
